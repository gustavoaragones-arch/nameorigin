    <h1>Baby Names That Go With Johnson</h1>
    <p class="contextual">When your last name is Johnson, the right first name can make the full name easier to say and remember. Rhythm and flow come from how the first name ends and the last name begins—vowel followed by consonant, or consonant by vowel, usually creates a clear break. Syllable balance helps too: Johnson has 2 syllables, and first names with a contrasting or similar count (e.g. two or three syllables) often sound balanced. Alliteration can be appealing in moderation, but avoiding repeated syllables or rhyme between first and last keeps the name from sounding sing-song. Hard versus soft consonants matter at the boundary: soft sounds flow more easily than hard stops. Cultural pairing is a personal choice; the lists below focus on phonetic fit so you can then narrow by meaning and origin. Each name links to its full page.</p>

    <section aria-labelledby="how-to-choose-heading"><h2 id="how-to-choose-heading">How to Choose a Name That Flows With Johnson</h2><p class="contextual">Avoid repeating the same syllable pattern in first and last—variety keeps the full name from sounding monotonous. Avoid rhyme: first and last names that rhyme can be memorable but often feel gimmicky. The most reliable test is to say the full name aloud. Listen for a clear break between first and last, and for a rhythm you like. Try it with a middle name if you plan to use one. If something feels off, pick another option from the boy, girl, or gender-neutral lists above. Every name on this page links to its full profile with meaning, origin, and popularity so you can choose with confidence.</p></section>
