    <h1>California vs Florida: Baby Name Comparison</h1>
    <p class="direct-answer">California and Florida are two of the largest jurisdictions in United States. Based on national United States rankings, top baby names show high overlap; state- or province-level data, when available, will reveal regional divergence. Volatility in the national top 10 over the past decade is 100%, reflecting how much naming trends have shifted. This page compares overlap, divergence, and volatility with cultural context.</p>

    <section aria-labelledby="overlap-heading">
      <h2 id="overlap-heading">Overlap</h2>
      <p class="contextual"><strong>Top 10 overlap: 20%</strong>. Overlap measures how many of the top 10 names appear in both jurisdictions' top 10 lists. With national data applied to both California and Florida, overlap is 20%. Once state or province-level data is integrated, we will report true regional overlap and which names are unique to each jurisdiction.</p>

    <section aria-labelledby="divergence-heading">
      <h2 id="divergence-heading">Divergence index</h2>
      <p class="contextual">The divergence index is the average absolute difference in rank for names that appear in both top 10 lists. A low index means the two jurisdictions rank names similarly; a high index means different ordering. For California vs Florida, the current index is 0 (national baseline). Regional data will show where California and Florida diverge.</p>
    </section>

    <section aria-labelledby="volatility-heading">
      <h2 id="volatility-heading">Volatility comparison</h2>
      <p class="contextual">Volatility compares the current top 10 to the top 10 from 2013. A volatility of 100% means 100% of the top names have changed over the period. Higher volatility suggests more trend-driven naming; lower volatility suggests more traditional, stable preferences. United States national volatility provides a baseline for comparing California and Florida when province- or state-level data is available.</p>
    </section>

    <section aria-labelledby="cultural-heading">
      <h2 id="cultural-heading">Cultural explanation</h2>
      <p class="contextual">California and Florida both have large Hispanic and diverse populations but differ in age structure and migration. Florida's retirees and Caribbean influence contrast with California's younger, Asian-heavy metros. Naming overlap can be high nationally; state-level rankings will reveal divergence—for example, names that rank higher in Florida's Cuban and Haitian communities versus California's Mexican and Asian clusters. Volatility may differ as each state's top 10 shifts with demographic change.</p>
    </section>

    <section aria-labelledby="methodology-heading">
      <h2 id="methodology-heading">Methodology</h2>
      <p class="contextual">Methodology: We use official birth statistics and government open data only. Overlap is computed as the share of names appearing in both jurisdictions' top 10. Divergence index is the average absolute rank difference for names in both lists. Volatility is the share of the top 10 that changed over the comparison period. All metrics will refine when state- or province-level datasets are integrated. No scraping of unreliable sources; data sources are cited in the footer.</p>
    </section>

    <section aria-labelledby="national-comparison-heading">
      <h2 id="national-comparison-heading">National comparison</h2>
      <p class="contextual">National comparison provides a baseline: both California and Florida are part of United States, so national top-10 rankings reflect the overall mix. When state or province-level data is added, we will show how California's top 10 differs from Florida's and from the national list. That will make overlap and divergence metrics more informative and support long-tail queries about regional naming. Parents and researchers can use these pages to see how naming culture varies between major jurisdictions.</p>
    </section>

    <section aria-labelledby="data-sourcing-heading">
      <h2 id="data-sourcing-heading">Data sourcing</h2>
      <p class="contextual">Data sourcing: All rankings are derived from official civil registry and government open data. For the United States we use the Social Security Administration's baby name data; for Canada we use Statistics Canada and provincial sources where published. We do not scrape unreliable or unverified sources. When state or province-level files are integrated, the same standards apply.</p>
