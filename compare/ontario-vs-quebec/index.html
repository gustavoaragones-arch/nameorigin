    <h1>Ontario vs Quebec: Baby Name Comparison</h1>
    <p class="direct-answer">Ontario and Quebec are two of the largest jurisdictions in Canada. Based on national Canada rankings, top baby names show high overlap; state- or province-level data, when available, will reveal regional divergence. Volatility in the national top 10 over the past decade is 0%, reflecting how much naming trends have shifted. This page compares overlap, divergence, and volatility with cultural context.</p>

    <section aria-labelledby="overlap-heading">
      <h2 id="overlap-heading">Overlap</h2>
      <p class="contextual"><strong>Top 10 overlap: 100%</strong>. Overlap measures how many of the top 10 names appear in both jurisdictions' top 10 lists. With national data applied to both Ontario and Quebec, overlap is 100%. Once state or province-level data is integrated, we will report true regional overlap and which names are unique to each jurisdiction.</p>
    </section>

    <section aria-labelledby="tables-heading">
      <h2 id="tables-heading">Top 10 boys and girls</h2>
      
    <table class="compare-table" aria-label="Top 10 boys Ontario vs Quebec">

    </section>

    <section aria-labelledby="divergence-heading">
      <h2 id="divergence-heading">Divergence index</h2>
      <p class="contextual">The divergence index is the average absolute difference in rank for names that appear in both top 10 lists. A low index means the two jurisdictions rank names similarly; a high index means different ordering. For Ontario vs Quebec, the current index is 0 (national baseline). Regional data will show where Ontario and Quebec diverge.</p>
    </section>

    <section aria-labelledby="volatility-heading">
      <h2 id="volatility-heading">Volatility comparison</h2>
      <p class="contextual">Volatility compares the current top 10 to the top 10 from 2013. A volatility of 0% means 0% of the top names have changed over the period. Higher volatility suggests more trend-driven naming; lower volatility suggests more traditional, stable preferences. Canada national volatility provides a baseline for comparing Ontario and Quebec when province- or state-level data is available.</p>
    </section>

    <section aria-labelledby="cultural-heading">
      <h2 id="cultural-heading">Cultural explanation</h2>
      <p class="contextual">Ontario and Quebec are Canada's largest provinces with the most distinct naming cultures. Quebec's French naming and approved-name lists produce rankings that diverge strongly from Ontario's English and multicultural mix. Overlap is typically lower than Ontario-Alberta or Alberta-Quebec. Volatility and divergence metrics will be informative once provincial data is integrated. Immigration to Montreal and Toronto drives different name clusters.</p>
    </section>

    <section aria-labelledby="methodology-heading">
      <h2 id="methodology-heading">Methodology</h2>
      <p class="contextual">Methodology: We use official birth statistics and government open data only. Overlap is computed as the share of names appearing in both jurisdictions' top 10. Divergence index is the average absolute rank difference for names in both lists. Volatility is the share of the top 10 that changed over the comparison period. All metrics will refine when state- or province-level datasets are integrated. No scraping of unreliable sources; data sources are cited in the footer.</p>
    </section>

    <section aria-labelledby="national-comparison-heading">
      <h2 id="national-comparison-heading">National comparison</h2>
      <p class="contextual">National comparison provides a baseline: both Ontario and Quebec are part of Canada, so national top-10 rankings reflect the overall mix. When state or province-level data is added, we will show how Ontario's top 10 differs from Quebec's and from the national list. That will make overlap and divergence metrics more informative and support long-tail queries about regional naming. Parents and researchers can use these pages to see how naming culture varies between major jurisdictions.</p>
    </section>

    <section aria-labelledby="data-sourcing-heading">
      <h2 id="data-sourcing-heading">Data sourcing</h2>
      <p class="contextual">Data sourcing: All rankings are derived from official civil registry and government open data. For the United States we use the Social Security Administration's baby name data; for Canada we use Statistics Canada and provincial sources where published. We do not scrape unreliable or unverified sources. When state or province-level files are integrated, the same standards apply.</p>
