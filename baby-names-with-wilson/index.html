    <h1>Baby Names That Go With Wilson</h1>
    <p class="contextual">Choosing a first name that flows well with Wilson starts with rhythm and flow: how the end of the first name meets the start of the last. Syllable balance matters—a one-syllable surname like Wilson often pairs best with two- or three-syllable first names, so the full name has a clear rhythm. Alliteration (matching first letters) can work when the sounds are soft, but repeated hard consonants at the boundary (e.g. both names ending and starting with the same strong consonant) tend to feel heavy. Soft consonants (l, m, n, r) and vowels create smoother transitions than hard stops (t, k, p). Cultural pairing is another layer: names from the same or related traditions can sound cohesive, but the phonetic rules above apply regardless of origin. Below you will find boy names, girl names, and gender-neutral names that pair well with Wilson, each with a short note on why they work, plus a section on how to choose and test a name.</p>

    <section aria-labelledby="how-to-choose-heading"><h2 id="how-to-choose-heading">How to Choose a Name That Flows With Wilson</h2><p class="contextual">Avoid repeated syllables: if Wilson has a repeated pattern, choose a first name that doesn’t echo it, so the full name doesn’t sound redundant. Avoid rhyme between first and last—names that rhyme can feel playful but often wear thin. The best check is to say the full name aloud several times: listen for smooth transitions, clear breaks, and a rhythm that feels natural. Try it in different contexts (e.g. “This is [First] Wilson”) and with a middle name if you use one. If the names run together or feel awkward, try another from the lists above. Each name links to its meaning and origin so you can explore further.</p></section>
