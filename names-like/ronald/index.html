    <section aria-labelledby="why-heading"><h2 id="why-heading">Why People Look for Names Like Ronald</h2><p class="contextual">Many people look for names like Ronald because they like its style but want options. They might want something that feels familiar—recognizable and in line with current tastes—without being so common that it loses its distinctiveness. Cultural overlap is another draw: names from the same origin or language can create a cohesive set for siblings or reflect shared heritage.
