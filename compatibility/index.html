    <h1>First & Last Name Compatibility</h1>
    <p class="contextual">Find first names that sound good with your last name. Browse by popular surnames or use the compatibility hub to explore. We score names by syllable balance, vowel-consonant flow, and length. Names that end in a vowel often pair well with last names starting with a consonant, and vice versa. Cultural matching suggests names from related traditions.</p>
    <p class="contextual">Each last name page lists first names that tend to flow well phonetically. The compatibility tool helps when you have a specific surname in mind. Use the links below to try Smith, Garcia, Johnson, Williams, or Nguyen. Each name links to its full profile for meaning, origin, and popularity. Browse by letter, country, or style for more options.</p>
